## About the Project

open8 is a PICO-8 emulator written in **C99** and currently under active development.
Built with portability as a primary goal, it is designed to run on a wide variety
of platforms, including devices such as the Nokia N-Gage. In principle, any system
supported by **SDL3** ([**Simple DirectMedia Layer 3**](https://www.libsdl.org/))
should be able to run open8.

## Why Another PICO-8 Emulator?

There are already several excellent PICO-8 emulators available, including
[fake-08](https://github.com/jtothebell/fake-08),
[pemsa](https://github.com/egordorichev/pemsa) and
[retro8](https://github.com/Jakz/retro8). Each of these projects serves its
own purpose and has contributed significantly to the community.

However, most existing emulators are written in modern C++, which can present
challenges when targeting older hardware and operating systems. These platforms
often have limited compiler support and may struggle with newer language features.

open8 takes a different approach by using **C99**, prioritizing portability and
compatibility across a broad range of systems. This focus makes it particularly
well-suited for the retro homebrew community, where support for legacy hardware
is often a key requirement. By keeping the codebase in C, open8 aims to remain
accessible, lightweight, and easy to port to unconventional or
resource-constrained platforms.

## Playdate

The Playdate port uses
[pd-rom-picker](https://github.com/pomettini/pd-rom-picker) to browse carts in:

```text
/Shared/Emulation/p8/games/
```

Copy `.p8`, `.p8.png`, or `.png` PICO-8 cartridges into that folder. Text
`.p8` carts load their `__lua__`, `__gfx__`, `__gff__`, `__map__`, `__sfx__`,
and `__music__` sections. They must be self-contained; PICO-8 `#include`
directives are not resolved on Playdate.

Use the Playdate system-menu **ROM Picker** item to return to the browser and
switch carts safely.

After cloning, initialise the picker submodule:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
